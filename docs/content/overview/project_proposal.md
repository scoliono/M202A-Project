# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

We want to create peer-to-peer local ad-hoc file sharing software similar to BitTorrent or IPFS that multiple clients can use at once to deliver file updates to each other on the go, but without an internet connection.

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

Currently, peer-to-peer file sharing protocols such as BitTorrent do exist, which chunks files and allows transfers from various peers at once [1]. Additonally, certain operating systems like Windows do support decentralized update delivery over LAN, through a feature called Delivery Optimization [2]. BitTorrent, though, requires a central server known as a tracker, meaning it is unusable without an internet connection [1]. Windows' Delivery Optimization requires a central router in order to discover peers over LAN. We wish to create a system that purely uses Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi Direct to bypass the need altogether for an internet connection.

Apple AirDrop uses Bluetooth for advertisement and Wi-Fi to do peer-to-peer file transfers [3]. However, it only supports a single unidirectional connection between two devices at a time, and transfers files from start to finish rather than supporting partial chunks.

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

Our approach uses Bluetooth LE for peers to advertise which files and chunks are available for sharing, and then a Wi-Fi Direct connection between each pair of peers to do the actual file transfer. Therefore, no prior network infrastructure is required at all, and devices consume minimal power when not actively transferring files. We believe this idea has a good chance of succeeding because it builds on top of the P2P file sharing aspect of BitTorrent and IPFS, while using the mesh topology that has seen widespread adoption in enterprise and home networks today.

## 4. Potential Impact

From a technical standpoint, if our project is successful, it would greatly reduce cloud computing operating costs for tech companies because most people wouldn't need to download their files directly from the companies' CDNs, so less bandwidth would be used. By taking some of the most data-consuming file transfers offline, widespread adoption of this technology would significantly reduce network congestion around the globe.

Speaking more broadly, though, our project would make technology more accessible to those in disadvantaged areas without a reliable internet connection. In certain parts of the U.S. such as Detroit, entire neighborhoods still lack high-speed internet access [10], and therefore the only option for receiving device updates at a reasonable speed without traveling is to download them from someone else. The proliferation of peer-to-peer mesh networks could also help disseminate information among those who live under oppressive governments. In Cuba, for example, nearly no one has access to the internet, and they distribute American media by smuggling USB drives into the country and passing around copies [11]. With a multi-hop mesh network like ours, information could spread over a much larger area more quickly, and its decentralized nature makes it resistant to government censorship.

## 5. Challenges

Due to the wireless nature of this project, real-world tests could be negatively impacted by interference from other devices within range, especially in densely populated areas. If needed, we can simulate a worst-case connection loss scenario by physically unplugging select devices from power while they are in use.

One challenge that we anticipate is the differences in penetration between a 2.4GHz Bluetooth signal and a 5GHz Wi-Fi signal. This could lead to a situation where two clients are able to advertise their metadata to each other, but then can't initiate the actual file transfer. This issue might be prevented by temporarily blacklisting peers which might be detectable over Bluetooth but fail to connect over Wi-Fi.

Also, the question of managing multiple peer connections simultaneously could present a challenge. It may not be possible to run multiple Wi-Fi Direct connections at the same time, meaning that a client might have to use time-division multiplexing to switch between them. If it is possible, the question remains if we should put each connection on a separate thread, or run on a single thread with coroutines, since there could potentially be thread-unsafe resources at play.

As for real-world security risks, there is a possibility of a peer "poisoning" the file chunks it transfers to other peers without a central source of truth to provide trustworthy checksums. This is a complex problem that we will not consider for the scope of this project. We also do not plan to use encryption between peers in our implementation, so the packets transferred could be sniffed by a third party.

## 6. Requirements for Success

Knowledge of the Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi Direct protocols is necessary. The code will be written in Python, so knowledge of that language is assumed. In terms of hardware, the code should be able to run on any device supporting the aforementioned wireless protocols, but we are using three Raspberry Pi Zero 2 Ws because they are cheap. Power banks are also necessary in order to do real-world on-the-go testing.

## 7. Metrics of Success

Several metrics of success that we would consider include: average file transfer speed, file transfer speed to flood a network, maximum number of connectable peers, power consumption when idle (not yet connected to a peer), power consumption while a file transfer is in progress, and maximum range from which a file can be successfully transferred between peers. Ideally, all of the metrics will be high except power consumption, which should be just a couple hundred milliwatts because we are using low-power devices with the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol.

## 8. Execution Plan

Describe the key tasks in executing your project, and in case of team project describe how will you partition the tasks.


For the midterm presentation, our goal is to just get two devices to advertise file chunk metadata to each other and initiate a Wi-Fi Direct connection.

The main execution steps are as follows:

1. Test BLE connection between 2 Raspberry Pis
2. Test Wi-Fi Direct between 2 Raspberry Pis
3. Develop a protocol for advertising which files, chunks, and versions a device has over BLE.
4. Implement that protocol
5. Implement the Wi-Fi Direct handshake and file transfer of chunks.
6. Test the full system


## 9. Related Work

### 9.a. Papers

The decentralized peer-to-peer network topology that we are using in our project has been discussed at great length in existing literature, although not necessarily with an emphasis on embedded platforms or specific wireless technologies.

In [8], a novel peer-to-peer protocol design is discussed which increases stability in scenarios when peers are not expected to persist on the network and dedicate themselves to seeding assets which they have received in full, as is often the case with BitTorrent. This could be relevant to our protocol design when deciding which chunks of a file to transfer to another peer, especially due to the highly ephemeral nature of wireless communication between moving embedded devices.

nTorrent is an evolution of the BitTorrent protocol which uses Named Data Networking (NDN) instead of the traditional TCP/IP networking stack [9]. This seems pertinent to our project because we want the general capabilities of BitTorrent but without relying on internet technologies. Indeed, we intend on creating a data-centric protocol similar in purpose to NDN. Instead of locating a specific peer's IP address from which to receive data packets, a client in a data-centric protocol puts out a request for a specific asset, and who exactly serves the response is left up to the network. One of the nTorrent authors wrote a follow-up publication [12] demonstrating how it could be adapted to work in a multi-hop ad hoc environment, much like our own situation, and discusses the issue of peers within range that want different assets from each other; her solution is to have nodes which are dedicated purely to forwarding.

The IPFS protocol is discussed in [13]. IPFS is worth mentioning because it includes versioned snapshots of files in a similar manner to Git, while also having the decentralized swarm characteristics of BitTorrent, and our own project will need to support versioning capabilities. A lot of the protocol includes security considerations which we will probably not spend time implementing now, but shows a possible path forward for future study.

### 9.b. Datasets

This project does not involve machine learning, so we are not using any training datasets. However, we will need to use sample files of some sort to demonstrate file transfer capabilities, eventually building an update dissemination mechanism on top of that. At first, we may use a large static asset such as the Big Buck Bunny short film [7] to test the reliability of large monolithic file transfers. In order to test versioning and content spanning multiple files, we may use randomly generated binaries of our own, or even grab a copy of any open source code repository available online, taking various commits to simulate diffs between versions.

### 9.c. Software

We plan to use the following libraries in our code:

1. bleak: Scanning & Connecting [4]
2. BlueZâ€™s D-Bus API: BLE Advertising [5]
3. Wi-Fi Direct [6]
