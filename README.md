## Running the Website

The website, located under `/docs`, is built with Hugo. Every page is written as a Markdown file. The repo uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and serve the webpage at the above link. While developing locally, you can get a live preview of your changes by running `hugo serve`.

## Running the Code

Python 3 will be used to run the code. It is expected that you are using a device with Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi Direct (we are using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W).
